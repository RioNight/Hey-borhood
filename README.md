Hack for Social Good

Directions for Use:
This app must be run in a Java-compatible environment. We coded this using the IntelliJ IDE using Java, Maven, and FXML. 
To run the app, enter the directory the code is in, and run:
1) mvn clean compile
2) mvn exec:java
When the app runs, you will see the landing page called Hey-borhood.
3) Click on the "Create Account" button to be taken to the preferences page.
4) Click anywhere on the page to be taken to the "Start Chatting" screen
5) Click anywhere again to see a map of recommended "hey-bors" to start chatting with
6) Click anywhere to be taken to an example chatting screen showing how messaging a hey-bor can look like

Project Issue:
Loneliness is a major cause for depression among elderlies and is associated with increased risks of depression, heart disease, weakened immune system, dementia, and early death. 


Social isolation and loneliness:
Higher rates of depression, heart disease, weakened immune systems, dementia, and lower lifespan.  
Living alone and not being mobile enough to leave home 
Feeling alone and disconnected from others 
Major loss or changes in life 
Lack of physical exercise and activity 


Solution: Hey-borhood
We propose building a community chat app that would allow elderly people to combat loneliness.

Users & Use cases: Elderlies and Hey-Bors (volunteers)	
The main feature of this app would be an accessible chatbox that matches elderly people and Hey-Bors to each other to allow for easy and effortless communication with one another. 

Elderly and Hey-Bors would create accounts using their identity card and would create a short profile about themselves with their hobbies and interests.

When an elderly is ready, they can initiate a “match” with the nearest randomly selected Hey-Bor that is currently available. On their first meeting, both the Hey-Bors and the elderly will be communicating with each other anonymously. After a successful match, if the elderly are satisfied with their matched Hey-Bors they can choose to continue matching with their Hey-Bor. The elderly can now choose to reveal themselves and share their profile, with the now-revealed Hey-Bor. 


Additional Features:
Elderlies will be able to chat, call, video call, and set up in-person meet-ups with their Hey-Bor. 

Elderlies and Hey-Bor’s alike can browse through the community tab which shows several user’s profile pages.

Elderlies will have the option to reject a Hey-Bor on their first meeting or report a Hey-Bor if they are dissatisfied with their matched Hey-Bor.

Hey-Bor’s who receive a certain amount of rejects, or are reported will immediately be questioned and banned from using the app.
